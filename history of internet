Alongside, Escalated Cold War played a major role in the creation of the internet.
The Soviet Union had deployed the Sputnik satellite which led the Defense Department
of the United States to examine the possibilities of communicating information despite nuclear. 
  The situation resulted in the development of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), which, 
later on, evolved into the Internet. In the initial days, ARPANET became a huge success with restricted
participation where it was accessible to academic and research institutions that had contracts with the
US Defense Department. The scenario led to the formation of new networks in order to facilitate the need 
for information sharing with other people.

Earlier there wasnâ€™t any standard mechanism for the computer networks that would enable them to communicate
with each other. Transfer Control Protocol (TCP/IP) which was developed in 1970, was adopted as a new communication
  protocol for ARPANET in 1983. The technology enabled various computers on different networks to communicate
with each other and this is how the Internet was officially born on January 1, 1983.
